Intent

    Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
    Adapter lets classes work together, that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.


The classes/objects participating in adapter pattern:

    Target - defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.
    Adapter - adapts the interface Adaptee to the Target interface.
    Adaptee - defines an existing interface that needs adapting.
    Client - collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
